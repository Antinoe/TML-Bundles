Supplies the game with a variety of portable containers that store items by List, not by Slot.

Far too many Storage Systems operate by Slots. The problem with this concept is that they limit how many different kinds of items you can fit inside. What if the Player were to indulge in the collection of hundreds of distinct herbs for cooking/potions, but are stocked up with other luggage?

This irritable consistency is why I directed the main focus of this project toward providing an alternative way of storing items.

**Features:**
-The Bundle, a unique container type that counts items by List, not by Slot, allowing a variety of materials/ingredients to be stored.
-Right-Click to stow/withdraw items. Shift-Right-Click to withdraw in Reverse Order.
-Hold "Up" while hovering your cursor over a bundle to preview the controls for it.
-These come in a few tiers, increasing in Max Capacity with each successor. (configurable)

**Bundle Types**
-Bundle: Standard bag. Holds a decent amount of Stackables.
-Pouch: Smaller, lighter alternative to the Bundle.
-Double Scabbard: Holds 3 weapons/tools.
-Apparel Case: Holds 5 clothing, accessories or armor.


**Planned features:**
-Individual keybinds for Withdraw Last, Withdraw Second-to-First when Right-Clicking.
-A slew of Convenience Features, like using the MouseWheel to scroll the selected item in the hovered Bundle.
